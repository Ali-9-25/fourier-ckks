# CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme)

This repository includes an interactive Jupyter notebook and code for the implementation of the CKKS scheme, a homomorphic encryption scheme supporting approximate arithmetic. It is based on the following paper:

**Homomorphic Encryption for Arithmetic of Approximate Numbers**  
Jung Hee Cheon, Andrey Kim, Miran Kim, and Yongsoo Song. 
Advances in Cryptology - ASIACRYPT 2017.
