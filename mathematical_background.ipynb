    "\n",
    "**Learning With Errors (LWE)** is a fundamental problem in post-quantum cryptography. It’s believed to be hard to solve even with quantum computers, making it a strong foundation for  **encryption**, **digital signatures**, and **fully homomorphic encryption** schemes. Noise is introduced to a value of a secret to hide the secret from unauthorized users.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Basic Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a secret vector $ \\mathbf{s} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^n $, the LWE problem involves random linear equations of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{s} + \\mathbf{e} \\equiv \\mathbf{b} \\pmod{q},\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "- $ \\mathbf{A} $ is an $ m \\times n $ matrix over $ \\mathbb{Z}_q $.  \n",
    "- $ \\mathbf{s} $ is the *secret* vector of length $ n $.  \n",
    "- $ \\mathbf{e} $ is the *error* (noise) vector in $ \\mathbb{Z}_q^m $, with small integer entries (often from a discrete Gaussian).  \n",
    "- $ \\mathbf{b} $ is the resulting vector of length $ m $.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The core challenge: from $ (\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{b}) $, recover $ \\mathbf{s} $ (or predict $ \\mathbf{b} $ from new rows of $ \\mathbf{A} $).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it hard to solve this problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Noise Hides the Secret:**  \n",
    "   Without the noise $ \\mathbf{e} $, you have a straightforward linear system $ \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{b} \\pmod{q} $. That’s easy to solve if $ \\mathbf{A} $ has full rank.  \n",
    "   But **small “error”** in each equation destroys perfect linearity, making it hard to find $ \\mathbf{s} $.\n",

    "\n",
    "Learning with errors over rings is the LWE problem specialised to polynomial rings over finite fields.\n",

    "R = \\mathbb{Z}[x]/(\\phi(x))\n",
    "$$ \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{Z}_q = \\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbb{Z}_q$ denotes that each coefficient is in the range $[0...q-1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- A secret element $ s(x) \\in R_q $ chosen uniformly at random.\n",
    "- A noise distribution $ \\chi $ over $ R $ that outputs \"small\" error polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "We obtain samples of the form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(a(x),\\; b(x) = a(x) \\cdot s(x) + e(x) \\bmod q)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ a(x) \\in R_q $ is chosen uniformly at random.\n",
    "- $ e(x) \\in R $ is drawn from the error distribution $ \\chi $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision and Search Variants**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main variants of the Ring-LWE problem:\n",
    "1. **Search Ring-LWE:** Given multiple samples $ (a_i(x), b_i(x)) $, recover the secret $ s(x) $.\n",
    "2. **Decision Ring-LWE:** Distinguish between tuples $ (a_i(x), b_i(x)) $ coming from the Ring-LWE distribution and tuples where $ b_i(x) $ is uniformly random in $ R_q $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardness of Ring-LWE is based on:\n",
    "- The assumed difficulty of solving certain lattice problems over ideal lattices in $ n $-dimensional space.\n",
    "- The structure introduced by using rings, which allows for efficiency improvements while maintaining security.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an adversary could solve the decision version of Ring-LWE, they would be able to distinguish between noisy linear equations and random data, which is as hard as approximating certain lattice problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Expression**\n",
    "\n",
    "A single Ring-LWE sample can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b(x) \\equiv a(x) \\cdot s(x) + e(x) \\pmod{q}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with $ \\deg(\\phi(x)) = n $, meaning arithmetic is performed modulo $ \\phi(x) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ring-LWE is used to build various cryptographic primitives, including:\n",
    "- Public-key encryption schemes.\n",
    "- Digital signature schemes.\n",
    "- Homomorphic encryption systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algebraic structure of polynomial rings allows for more compact keys and faster computations compared to non-ring LWE schemes, while still relying on hard lattice problems for security.\n",
